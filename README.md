# WorldWise App

- A pure traveling react (+vite) app, where a user can log in and keep tab of all their cities that they had travelled to.
- A user can click on the map to add a city, the app can auto populate the city's name, and country based on the coordinates clicked
- The selected city can be saved, together with the date of travelling and a comment can be added under each city as some sort of review.
